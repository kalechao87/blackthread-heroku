Three.js has a somewhat complicated set of classes that inherit from one another and are designed to mimic the [2D Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D). 

They inherit from each other like so:

[Curve](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/extras/core/Curve) &rarr; [CurvePath](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/extras/core/CurvePath) &rarr; [Path](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/extras/core/Path) &rarr; [Shape](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/extras/core/Shape).

And the there's [ShapePath](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/extras/core/ShapePath) which also inherits from CurvePath and is used internally by the [Font](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/extras/core/Font) class. But we'll take a look at that in the next tutorial.
