So far we have just created a simple coloured material for our mesh. If we want to create something more realistic we'll have to move onto using texture mapping. We'll start by loading up a simple color map. By changing just a couple of lines of code from the last example, we'll soon have this:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/84/three.js"></script>

<canvas id="example-canvas"></canvas>

<script>
  var canvas = document.querySelector('#example-canvas');

  var width = canvas.parentNode.clientWidth;
  var height = window.innerHeight;

  var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( {
    canvas: canvas,
   });
  renderer.setSize( width, height / 2 );

  // create a scene
  var scene = new THREE.Scene();

  // create a PerspectiveCamera
  var fov = 75;
  var aspect = width / ( height / 2 );
  var nearClippingPlane = 0.1;
  var farClippingPlane = 1000;

  var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( fov, aspect, nearClippingPlane, farClippingPlane );

  camera.position.set( 0, 0, 20 );

  // create a box buffer geometry
  var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry( 10, 10, 10 );

  var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

  // Set the loader's crossorigin to allow the texture to be loaded from github
  loader.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';

  var texture = loader.load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/textures/crate.gif');

  // create a material, set the color to white and set it's diffuse map to the texture
  var material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( {
      color: 0xffffff,
      map: texture,
  } );

  var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
  scene.add( mesh );

  // create a dark grey ambient with an intensity of 2.0 and add it to the scene
  var ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0x999999, 2.0 );
  scene.add( ambientLight );

  // Create a white directional light with an intensity of 2.0
  var directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 2.0 );
  directionalLight.position.set( 0, 10, 0 );
  scene.add( directionalLight );

  function animate() {

    requestAnimationFrame( animate );

    mesh.rotation.z += 0.01;
    mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
    mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;

    renderer.render( scene, camera );

  }

  animate();

</script>

If you still haven't set up a [server]({{site_url}}/tutorials/0.3-development-server) yet, don't worry. We'll use a [free textures
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/textures/crate.gif) from the github repo and we can bypass the security exception by setting the [TextureLoader.crossorigin](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader) property.

Open up a text editor and paste the [code](https://gist.github.com/looeee/c7aff28dcfbab3d9a662823b01027051#file-1-0-getting-started-html) from the previous tutorial.

First, let's replace our torus knot with a box.

Find the line:

{% highlight js %}
// create a torus knot buffer geometry
var geometry = new THREE.TorusKnotBufferGeometry( 5, 1, 100, 16 );
{% endhighlight %}

and replace it with

{% highlight js %}
// create a box buffer geometry
var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry( 10, 10, 10 );
{% endhighlight %}

If you load up the file you'll see that the torus knot has been replaced with a box. Next we'll load the texture. Directly under that last line, create a [TextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader):

{% highlight js %}
// create a box buffer geometry
var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry( 10, 10, 10 );

var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
{% endhighlight %}

Now, as mentioned above, since we are not loading the texture from a local directory we'll have to set the loader's cross origin property. In this case we can set it to anything we like, as long as it's not `undefined` or `null`. But in general the empty string `''` or `'anonymous'` is used.

{% highlight js %}
var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

loader.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
{% endhighlight %}

Now we are ready to load the texture:

{% highlight js %}
var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

loader.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';

var texture = loader.load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/textures/crate.gif');
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can apply it as the material's diffuse map:

{% highlight js %}
// create a material, set the color to purple and set it's diffuse map to the texture
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( {
    color: 0xb300b3,
    map: texture,
} );
{% endhighlight %}

And there we go!

<canvas id="example2-canvas"></canvas>

<script>
  var init = function() {
    var canvas = document.querySelector('#example2-canvas');

    var width = canvas.parentNode.clientWidth;
    var height = window.innerHeight;

    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( {
      canvas: canvas,
    });
    renderer.setSize( width, height / 2 );

    // create a scene
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();

    // create a PerspectiveCamera
    var fov = 75;
    var aspect = width / ( height / 2 );
    var nearClippingPlane = 0.1;
    var farClippingPlane = 1000;

    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( fov, aspect, nearClippingPlane, farClippingPlane );

    camera.position.set( 0, 0, 20 );

    // create a box buffer geometry
    var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry( 10, 10, 10 );

    var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

    // Set the loader's crossorigin to allow the texture to be loaded from github
    loader.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';

    var texture = loader.load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/textures/crate.gif');

    // create a material, set the color to white and set it's diffuse map to the texture
    var material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( {
        color: 0xb300b3,
        map: texture,
    } );

    var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
    scene.add( mesh );

    // create a dark grey ambient with an intensity of 2.0 and add it to the scene
    var ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0x999999, 2.0 );
    scene.add( ambientLight );

    // Create a white directional light with an intensity of 2.0
    var directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 2.0 );
    directionalLight.position.set( 0, 10, 0 );
    scene.add( directionalLight );

    function animate() {

      requestAnimationFrame( animate );

      mesh.rotation.z += 0.01;
      mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
      mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;

      renderer.render( scene, camera );

    }

    animate();

  }

  init();

</script>

Hmm... well not quite. The color of the material is multiplied with it's diffuse map. So if you want the map to display as you expect, you have to set the color to white, or `0xffffff`. Do that now, and you should see the example from the top of the page. Remember that you'll always have to set the color otherwise a random color will be assigned.

# Final code

<script src="https://gist.github.com/looeee/4c3146f9b368678e48a0c1072689b439.js"></script>

Here's the code converted to ES6 - again no major changes, just the `var`s changed to `const`s as in the first tutorial.
