At the moment our scene is not interactive. We'll add some simple controls in the form the `OrbitalControls`. This is the first thing that we want to use that is not part of the three.js core. That is, it is not included in the main `three.js` JavaScript file that we've been loading so far. Instead, it's in a separate file located at [/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js) in the three.js Github repository.

There are lots of other "examples" (or rather, plugins) contained here, and we'll go over how to use them later, in Section 8. But for now, let's add camera controls to our scene as a quick example of how to use these plugins.

Once again, we'll expand the previous example, and when we are done, we'll have this:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/84/three.js"></script>

<script src="/assets/js/vendor/threejs/OrbitControls.js"></script>

<canvas id="example-canvas"></canvas>

<script>
  var canvas = document.querySelector('#example-canvas');

  var width = canvas.parentNode.clientWidth;
  var height = window.innerHeight;

  var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( {
    canvas: canvas,
   });
  renderer.setSize( width, height / 2 );

  // create a scene
  var scene = new THREE.Scene();

  // create a PerspectiveCamera
  var fov = 75;
  var aspect = width / ( height / 2 );
  var nearClippingPlane = 0.1;
  var farClippingPlane = 1000;

  var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( fov, aspect, nearClippingPlane, farClippingPlane );

  camera.position.set( 0, 0, 20 );

  var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls( camera, renderer.domElement );

  // create a box buffer geometry
  var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry( 10, 10, 10 );

  var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

  loader.crossOrigin = '';

  var texture = loader.load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/textures/crate.gif');

  // create a material and set the color to purple
  var material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( {
      color: 0xffffff,
      map: texture,
  } );

  var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
  scene.add( mesh );

  // create a dark grey ambient with an intensity of 2.0 and add it to the scene
  var ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0x999999, 2.0 );
  scene.add( ambientLight );

  // Create a white directional light with an intensity of 2.0
  var directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 2.0 );
  directionalLight.position.set( 0, 10, 0 );
  scene.add( directionalLight );

  function animate() {

    requestAnimationFrame( animate );

    mesh.rotation.z += 0.01;
    mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
    mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;

    renderer.render( scene, camera );

  }

  animate();

</script>
