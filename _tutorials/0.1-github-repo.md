Everything officially related to the three.js project is contained in one rather [monolithic repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) on Github, maintained by the original creator of three.js, Ricardo Cabello AKA [@mrdoob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob), with the help of a couple of other main collaborators and an army of open source aficionados. It's a huge and very active repo - the 16th most starred Javascript library on Github in fact, and the 8th most forked, up there with superstars like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the latter of which we'll be making use of in Section 2 when we switch to using ES6.

It's quite overwhelming at first glance, but we only need to look inside these two folders.

## The /build folder
Contained in this folder are just three files, each of which contain the core `THREE` object that we'll be seeing a lot of. You only need to include one of these.

* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/build/three.js) - the uncompressed file containing the core `THREE` object. This is for use as a `<script>` tag, i.e. you can load three.js by putting `<script src="/js/three.js"></script>` in the `<head>` section of your html document.
* [three.min.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/build/three.min.js). This is the same file, but in compressed format. You webpage will load faster if you use this, as the filesize is smaller, but at the expense of potentially garbled error messages (in a attempt to shrink the file size, the compressor may rename functions - so `myLovelyLongAndDescriptiveFunctionName()` may become something like `gz()`). Generally you want to use `three.js` in development, and then switch to `three.min.js` in production.
* [three.module.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/build/three.module.js) was added quite recently - it's the same as three.js, but not compiled down to ES5 compatible code, so you can't include it as a `<script>`. Instead, it's intended to be used with a build tool. We'll be covering how to do this in Section 2.

## The /examples folder
We'll be looking at this folder in detail in Section 8. For now you just need to know that as well as containing code for all the [official examples](https://threejs.org/examples/), it contains all official plugins in the [/examples/js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js) folder (also known by the community as examples, confusingly), as well as lots of free to use [fonts](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/fonts/), [models](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/models/), full [scenes](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/scenes/) in the three.js JSON format, [sounds](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/sounds/) and [textures](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/textures/). You should definitely make sure that you are familiar with this folder and whenever you are working to understand a new feature of three.js, check [here](https://threejs.org/examples/) to see if there is an example that covers it and go over the corresponding source code.

## Other folders
Besides these two, you may find the following folders useful, although we won't be covering them further:

* [/docs](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/docs): All the files related to the official documentation and tutorials are kept here, although you'll probably find the [live version](https://threejs.org/docs/) easier to read!
* [/editor](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/editor/): The three.js community maintains an editor. If you want to look at the code, here it is, although again the [live version](https://threejs.org/editor/) will probably be more useful.
* [/src](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/): the uncompiled three.js source files. If you want to look under the hood, check here. It will be a lot clearer than trying to look through the huge compiled main file in the /build folder.
* [/test](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/test/): three.js unit tests are kept here. Unless you start developing for three.js you probably don't need to concern yourself with these.
* [/utils](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/utils/): here you will find a collection of [build tools](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/utils/build/), [converters](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/utils/converters/), [exporters](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/utils/exporters/) and [servers](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/utils/servers/). Aside from the build tools, which are used to compile the files in /src to the files in /build, I don't recommend using the tools here, as (at the time of writing), they are largely outdated. If you are stuck or need to write an exporter or converter yourself, by all means check these out. But we won't be covering them further.
