  <p>
    Hello, and welcome to my website! My name's Lewy, I'm a Irish front end JavaScript expert and recovering circus performer,
    specializing in WebGL with three.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently living the digital nomad dream in various beautiful places
    around South East Asia, climbing volcanoes, diving, eating spicy food
    and even doing a little programming from time to time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Have a look around the site for examples of my recent
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/work/">work</a>,
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/experiments/">experiments</a>,
    and my series of
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/tutorials/">tutorials</a>
    on getting up and running with three.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also find me on
    <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0138561bc4900bdef8">Upwork</a>,

    or lurking on the
